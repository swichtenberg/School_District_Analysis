# School District Analysis

## Background
The purpose of the project is to aggregate data from multiple schools within the school district to showcase trends in school performance. The initial analysis of the data revealed the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders had been altered, resulting in the need for a second analysis with the altered scores removed. The analysis will be used to assist the school board and superintendant in decision making related to the budgets and priorities.

## Results
### - How was the district summary affected?
The school district summary was minimally impacted when the altered scores were removed given the limited scope of the academic dishonesty and the large number of students in the district. The percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall decreased only fractionally. The overall passing percentage decreased from 65.2% to 64.9%.
### - How is the school summary affected?
Similar to the district summary, the school summary was also minimally impacted when the altered scores were removed. Only Thomas High School data was affected and the percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall decreased only fractionally. The overall passing percentage for Thomas High School decreased from 90.9% to 90.6%.
### - How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
