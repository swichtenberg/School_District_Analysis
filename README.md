# School District Analysis

## Background
The purpose of the project is to aggregate data from multiple schools within the school district to showcase trends in school performance. The initial analysis of the data revealed the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders had been altered, resulting in the need for a second analysis with the altered scores removed. The analysis will be used to assist the school board and superintendant in decision making related to the budgets and priorities.

## Results
### - How was the district summary affected?
The school district summary was minimally impacted when the altered scores were removed given the limited scope of the academic dishonesty and the large number of students in the district. The percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall decreased only fractionally. The overall passing percentage decreased from 65.2% to 64.9%.
### - How is the school summary affected?
Similar to the district summary, the school summary was also minimally impacted when the altered scores were removed. Only Thomas High School data was affected and the percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall decreased only fractionally. The overall passing percentage for Thomas High School decreased from 90.9% to 90.6%.
### - How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
The removal of the altered Thomas High School math and reading scores did not affect the school's overall performance relatitve to other schools. As seen in the comparison below, Thomas High School had the second highest overall passing percentage before and after the altered scores were removed.

### - How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect math and reading scores by grade
The removal of altered Thomas High School math and reading scores also minimally impact math and reading scores by grade. The removal of data did not affect 10th, 11th, and 12th grade math and reading scores and also did not affect 9th grade scores at schools other than Thomas High School. The greatest impact was on 9th grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School. All of the this data was removed and there are no longer any valid data for these students.
